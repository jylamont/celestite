**Note: This project was previously called "crystal-vue", but I just added support for Svelte, so, well, that name doesn't really work anymore :)**

## Introduction

Celestite allows you to use the full power of either [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) reactive components in your [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) web apps. It's a drop-in replacement for your view layer -- no more need for intermediate `.ecr` templates. With celestite, you write your backend server code in Crystal, your frontend client code in JavaScript & HTML, and everything works together seamlessly...and fast.

Pages are delivered to the client fully-rendered and SEO-friendly (like a traditional web app), but with the power and reactivity of Vue or Svelte taking over once the page has loaded.

This means you get the best of all worlds -- clients see lightning fast page loads (since the initial payload is pure HTML/CSS) yet still get the benefit of rich dynamic JavaScript-enabled components the load without stutters or flickers.

And your job as a developer is easier: Instead of writing an intermediate view layer (typically `.ecr` or similar templates) which glues your server code & client code together, you write pure components **once** with all your server-side data seamlessly blended in. Awesome, right?

[Aside: Celestite (the mineral) is a UV-reactive crystal...see what I did there...that's more commonly known as Celestine, but, hey, that's a much more common project name, so here we are.]

## Features

- `.vue` SFC (single-file component) support
- `.svelte` component support (**new in 0.1.2**)
- Server-side rendering w/ variables interpolated in Crystal and/or JavaScript
- Client-side hydration for full-featured reactive pages
- Configurable layouts/templates
- Built-in support for [Amber](https://amberframework.org) (other frameworks coming soon)

## Background

Traditional web apps were mostly server-powered -- a client (browser) would make a request, the server would do some processing, render the page, and send down HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript to spice things up. Pages loaded lightning fast and SEO was simple (crawlers saw basically the same thing as users).

With the advent of powerful JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and more recently, Svelte, much of the work shifted to the client. The server became a vessel for a client-loaded JavaScript bundle (and an API endpoint to communicate with that client) and your browser rendered most of what you'd see on the page via JavaScript. Web apps certainly became more powerful and dynamic (the notion of a Single Page App was born), but at the cost of higher initial load time, worse SEO (crawlers saw basically nothing since all the logic lived in JavaScript), and increased complexity (you now had to manage two view layers).

React, Vue, and Svelte all support Server Side Rendering support to mitigate this, but that support is baked solely into NodeJS (since it's JavaScript all the way down.)

Crystal is awesome and a joy to use for server-side web apps. Vue is awesome and a joy to use for client-side reactivity and UI composability. Svelte is the new kid on the block, but so far it looks even more promising than Vue.

Celestite now lets you bring those joys together. This is ideal for folks who believe the heavy lifting of page rendering should (mostly) be done by the server and yet still want the reactivity and dynamism of a powerful client-side framework.

#### THIS IS PREVIEW / EARLY ALPHA SOFTWARE

**This is not much more than a proof-of-concept at the moment, but it does work! Standard warnings apply - it will likely break/crash in spectacular and ill-timed glory, so don't poke it, feed it past midnight, or use it for anything mission-critical (yet).**

## Show Me The Money

Start with a regular 'ol Amber controller & `.ecr` template

```crystal
# home_controller.cr

class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    example_crystal_data = 1 + 1
    render("index.ecr")
  end
end
```

```html
# index.ecr

<div>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): <%= example_crystal_data %></p>
</div>
```

`example_crystal_data` is simple arithmetic here, but imagine it's a database query in a more complex application). In this simple example, the basic `.ecr` template works perfectly.

If you want to add some client-side reactivity and, say, a Vue or Svelte component, things get more complex. You'll have to split up your view logic between this `.ecr` file (which becomes rendered HTML) and the component (which doesn't get rendered until the client finishes loading), pass in `example_crystal_data` via props, load it via a backchannel API call, or use some other series of intermediate glue steps.

Why not skip all of that and make the data available directly in the Vue component? Replace the `render` call with our new `celestite_render` macro and move our server-side calculation into a special `@vue_context` (or, if you're using Svelte, `@sapper_session`) object:

```crystal
# home_controller.cr - celestite powered

class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @vue_context[:example_crystal_data] = 1 + 1
    celestite_render(@vue_context)
  end
end
```

Now instead of a server-rendered `.ecr` template + client-rendered Vue component, you skip the `.ecr` step entirely and put all of your view code (including CSS) into a single Vue component that's both server- and client-rendered:

```vue
// Index.vue

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      This was rendered server-side (by crystal): {{ example_crystal_data }}
    </p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
module.exports = {
  computed: {
    example_crystal_data() {
      return this.$store.state.crystal.example_crystal_data
    }
}
</script>

<style scoped>
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
```

Et voila:

<img src="doc/celestite-example-1.png" width=522/>

Ok that's not so exciting. And it's a bit more verbose. But there's more to this, I promise! The key is that number 2 is not just a static ASCII character loaded via HTML -- it's actually a fully reactive element of a live Vue component:

<img src="doc/celestite-example-2a.png" width=522/>

A quick peek at the raw HTML shows our server's doing all the hard work (which is what servers were designed to do) and sending us a fully rendered page that, even if it were more complex, would load quickly and be SEO-friendly:

```html
❯ curl localhost:3000

<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="preload" href="/dist/cvue.main.js" as="script" />
    <style data-vue-ssr-id="ba041780:0">
      h1[data-v-5e7337c8] {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="celestite-app" data-server-rendered="true">
      <div data-v-5e7337c8>
        <h1 data-v-5e7337c8>Hello World!</h1>
        <p data-v-5e7337c8>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): 2</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script src="/dist/cvue.main.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

There's a lot going on in there and we'll get into more detail later, but in short: Celestite is taking the result of the server-side calculation (1 + 1), rendering the HTML, inserting a default layout, injecting the relevant CSS (scoped to this component), and compiling & linking to a client-side JS bundle.

### Data Computation Options

Celestite gives you flexibility in where your data computation is done - on the server (in Crystal), on the server (in Node/JavaScript), or on the client (in JavaScript via Vue or Svelte). It totally depends on the needs of your application, and you can mix-and-match.

#### 1) Server-side: Crystal

Our first example did the "work" (calculating 1 + 1) server-side, in crystal. Let's look at the other options...

#### 2) Server-side: JavaScript

Because celestite uses a live [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) process behind the scenes, you can choose to do computations in that context. This gives you access to the whole ecosystem of Node modules to use in your application as-needed.

Changing our Vue component slightly:

```vue
// Index.vue

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      This was rendered server-side (by crystal): {{ example_crystal_data }}
    </p>
    +
    <p>This was rendered server-side (by node): {{ example_node_data }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  module.exports = {
    computed: {
      example_crystal_data() {
        return this.$store.state.crystal.example_crystal_data
      }
    },
+   data() {
+     return {
+      example_node_data: 2 + 2
+     }
+   },
  }
</script>

...
```

Or the Svelte equivalent:

```html
// index.svelte

<div>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): { example_crystal_data }</p>
  <p>This was rendered server-side (by node): { example_node_data }</p>
</div>

<script>
  import { stores } from "@sapper/app";
  const { session } = stores();

  const example_crystal_data = $session.example_crystal_data;
  const example_node_data = 2 + 2;
</script>

...
```

Gives us, as expected:

<img src="doc/celestite-example-2.png" width=522/>

And again, this is all being done server-side, the raw HTML tells the same story:

```html
❯ curl localhost:3000 ...

<div data-v-5e7337c8>
  <h1 data-v-5e7337c8>Hello World!</h1>
  <p data-v-5e7337c8>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): 2</p>
  <p data-v-5e7337c8>This was rendered server-side (by node): 4</p>
</div>

...
```

#### 3) Client-side: JavaScript

Thus far we haven't actually done any client-side DOM manipulation even though we're using a client-side reactive framework. Ironic, right?

Of course you can have celestite do pure client rendering if you want. We do this by taking advantage of how Vue component lifecycles work (the `mounted()` hook is not called when doing SSR, only on the client).

Let's modify our Vue template once more:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      This was rendered server-side (by crystal): {{ example_crystal_data }}
    </p>
    <p>This was rendered server-side (by node): {{ example_node_data }}</p>
    <p>{{ example_client_data }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  module.exports = {
    computed: {
      example_crystal_data() {
        return this.$store.state.crystal.example_crystal_data
      }
    },
    data() {
      return {
        example_node_data: 2 + 2,
+       example_client_data: null
      }
    },
+   mounted() {
+     this.example_client_data = `This was rendered client-side (by vue): ${4 + 4}`
+   }
  }
</script>

...
```

Or the equivalent in Svelte:

```html
// index.svelte

<div>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): { example_crystal_data }</p>
  <p>This was rendered server-side (by node): { example_node_data }</p>
  <p>{ example_client_data }</p>
</div>

<script>
  import { stores } from "@sapper/app";
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  const { session } = stores();

  const example_crystal_data = $session.example_crystal_data;
  const example_node_data = 2 + 2;

  let example_client_data;

  onMount(() => {
    example_client_data = `This was rendered client-side (by Svelte): ${4 + 4}`;
  });
</script>

...
```

And we see:

<img src="doc/celestite-example-3.png" width=522/>

All looking good. Same with the raw HTML:

```html
❯ curl localhost:3000 ...

<div data-v-5e7337c8>
  <h1 data-v-5e7337c8>Hello World!</h1>
  <p data-v-5e7337c8>This was rendered server-side (by crystal): 2</p>
  <p data-v-5e7337c8>This was rendered server-side (by node): 4</p>
  <p data-v-5e7337c8></p>
</div>

...
```

Note our most recent addition is not being rendered on the server, as it should(n't).

#### Server rendering + Client-side hydration

Let's make this more interesting: We want to actually have some fun, live, dynamic stuff happen on the client (which is why we're using frameworks like Vue & Svelte in the first place, right?)

Celestite's hybrid rendering model that we saw in the first example (which exposes the power of both server- and client-side rendering) is called client-side hydration, and it's awesome.

Our fun, live, dynamic stuff is going to be a....clock. Ok fine I'll come up with a better example later. But for now it's simple and shows off the concept.

Our new Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>The current time is: {{ current_time }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
module.exports = {
  data() {
    return {
      current_time: new Date();
    };
  },
  methods: {
    setCurrentTime() {
      this.current_time = new Date();
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    setInterval(this.setCurrentTime, 100);
  }
};
</script>
```

Translating this to English, we are:

- defining a reactive data element in `data()` called `current_time` that gets an initial value of `Date.now()`
- defining a method called `setCurrentTime()` that sets `current_time` to be `Date.now()` when called, and
- using the `mounted()` lifecycle hook to call `setCurrentTime()` every 100 ms when the component is mounted (client-only)

When a request comes in, the server will render the component and send down the following (static) HTML, which represents a snapshot of the current time as of when the request came in:

```html
❯ curl localhost:3000 ...

<div>
  <p>The current time is: 1547520952139</p>
</div>

...
```

In your browser, the javascript bundle (along with Vue) will load and automatically understand that this is server-rendered Vue code. It then "hydrates" the static element and makes it dynamic, as such:

<img src="doc/celestite-example-4.gif" width=522/>

Huzzah! Server-rendered initial view, reactive (hydrated) elements after load, and a rich dynamic (sort of) UI for the user, and all in a single piece of view code. Heaven.

The Svelte version of this is even simpler, thanks to the mini-framework that powers this functionality ([Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev)):

```html
<div>
  <p>The current time is { current_time }</p>
</div>

<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  let current_time = new Date();
  let setCurrentTime = () => {
    current_time = new Date();
  };

  onMount(() => {
    setInterval(setCurrentTime, 100);
  });
</script>
```

### Requirements

- Crystal 0.27+
- Yarn 1.12+
- Node 10+

The render server was built using node 10.15.3 (in particular it uses the WHATWG URL Standard, which was added in Node 7+.) It doesn't need to do this, strictly-speaking, and if there's a compelling reason to support earlier versions of Node I'm happy to make this change.)

## Installation

(Note: This is a bit more manual than I'd like. Automation to come.)

Celestite has been developed / tested with the [Amber](https://amberframework.org) web framework, but designed to work standalone as well. There's also no reason it won't work with [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org/), [Kemal](http://kemalcr.com/), etc. (but no work integrating with those has been done yet.)

**1) Add celestite to your application's `shard.yml` and run `shards install`:**

```yaml
dependencies:
  celestite:
    github: noahlh/celestite
    version: ~> 0.1.2
```

**2) Include the helper `Celestite::Adapter::Amber` in your `application_controller.cr`.**

This adds the `celestite_render` macro and sets up the `@vue_context` and `@sapper_session` objects (these objects serve the exact same purpose, but they're named according to the convention of their respective underlying frameworks).

```crystal
  # application_controller.cr

  require "jasper_helpers"

  class ApplicationController < Amber::Controller::Base
    include JasperHelpers
+   include CrystalVue::Adapter::Amber
  end
```

**3) Add `celestite_amber_init.cr` to /config/initializers`**

[An example](/config/celestite_amber_init.example.cr) is provided. Vue and Svelte have slightly differnet options, so customize/uncomment the config file as-needed. You can name this file whatever you want, just so long as it gets called upon initialization.

### Vue installation

These steps are only needed if you're using Vue as your rendering engine. Otherwise, skip to the Svelte section.

**i. Add a `routes.js` file to `/config`.**

This should export an array of path/component mappings, for example:

```javascript
// routes.js

export default [
  { path: "/", component: "home/Index" },
  { path: "/about", component: "static/About" },
  { path: "/user/:userid", component: "users/User" }
];
```

This is almost exactly like the routes object you'd use with [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#html) and in fact uses that underneath.

There is one small difference here, in that with vue-router you're specifying the actual component (that you've `import`'ed). Here, instead, you'll specify a string with the component name (and subdirectory off the main components folder).

This is annoyingly redundant (since you've already specified your routes w/ controllers & actions in Amber), and also somewhat hard to reason about, so it's going on the chopping block soon and I'll figure out a more elegant solution.

**ii. Add a default layout.**

This is the shell HTML into which your Vue components will be injected. You must include the magic comment `<!--vue-ssr-outlet-->` where you'd like your components injected.

```html
<!-- main.html -->

<html>
  <head>
    ... head ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--vue-ssr-outlet-->
  </body>
</html>
```

TODO, high on the list: Variable interpolation in this layout so you can do dynamic titles, etc.

### Svelte installation

Svelte has a notably simpler installation process, thanks to the hard work of the [Sapper](http://sapper.svelte.dev) project, on which this is based. They did a lot of the heavy lifting for us!

**i. Add a static route for your build_dir to Amber's static pipeline**

This is because of a slight hitch with how Sapper works behind the scenes, but essentially: the client needs to be able to access the relevant JS files in /client, yet Sapper needs complete control over that directory (it wipes it with each new build). So we simultaneously give it its own directory and also make it available via the root path.

```crystal
 # routes.cr

 pipeline :static do
   plug Amber::Pipe::Error.new
   plug Amber::Pipe::Static.new("./public")
+  plug Amber::Pipe::Static.new("./public/celestite")
 end
```

### And finally...

**4) Add your `.vue` or `.svelte` files to your components directory and start building**

## Usage Details

### celestite_render macro

`celestite_render(context : Celestite::Context = nil, path : String? = nil, template : String? = nil)`

Performs the render. This is to be called where you'd normally call `render` in your controllers. It doesn't need any parameters by default (it automatically extracts the path of the method calling it based on your Amber routes), but you may use the following optional parameters:

`context : Celestite::Context`

The Amber helper creates a special Hash-like object called `@vue_context` or `@sapper_session` (they are the same thing, just named differently to match the convention of the underlying framework). Any variables you'd like available in your components go in here, using a Symbol key of the desired name.

So if you want to access `example_crystal_data` in your vue component, assign the relevant value to `@vue_context[:example_crystal_data]`. Likewise, you can assign `@sapper_session[:example_crystal_data]`.

Behind the scenes, celestite sets up a [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) store to be accessed in the Vue component. The crystal-rendered data (`example_crystal_data`) is automatically injected into that store (under the `crystal` namespace) and is available under `this.$store.state.crystal` in all of your Vue components.

When using Svelte components, the same functionality is acheived using Sapper's [session-seeding](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Seeding_session_data) mechanism.

**`path : String?`**

If you need to manually specify which path you're rending (i.e. you're not in Amber), you can pass in a string parameter. In Amber this will be assigned a default value equal to the current Amber route the controller method is handling.

**`template : String?`**

(Vue only) Which layout/template you'd like to render the component in. Uses the default template specified in the init file if none specified on render.

### Why is the syntax `celestite_render('/index')` and not `celestite_render(Index.vue)`?

With `.ecr` templates, you're explicitly rendering a specific template. It would logically make sense to do the same, but Celestite doesn't quite work that way -- instead, you render a route, which is composed of a path and a component. Since the mapping between a controller's routes & actions is already established, specifically naming the component file would be redundant.

This can be slightly confusing in Vue-land, I might consider making it a bit more explicit as this project develops (eliminate the need for a routes.js and build that mapping implicitly by looking at the rendered components in each controller action.)

## Server Rendering (Node/JavaScript)

[(From Vue's docs on SSR)](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/universal.html)

> Since there are no dynamic updates, of all the lifecycle hooks, only `beforeCreate` and `created` will be called during SSR. This means any code inside other lifecycle hooks such as `beforeMount` or `mounted` will only be executed on the client.

Outside the lifecycle hooks, anything in your `data` object will be rendered both server- and client-side (on initial load).

There are some other considerations to keep in mind when writing components that will be used both on the server and client. [You can read more about those here.](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/universal.html)

### Client-only rendering (Vue)

If you want something rendered _only_ on the client and not in any server context, you can use any lifecycle method other than `beforeCreate` and `created`. [See the Vue docs for complete details on all lifecycle hooks.](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Options-Lifecycle-Hooks)

### Client-only rendering (Svelte)

Svelte has a similar (but opposite) mechanism built in - [the onMount() lifecycle hook](https://svelte.dev/docs#onMount). If you want a component rendered only in the client, use this hook. Otherwise, it will render the component on both the client and the server.

## How Celestite Works

Celestite launches and manages a local node process that runs a very lightweight HTTP server to perform server-side rendering. The `celestite_render()` macro simply makes an HTTP call to that node server with any Crystal-computed variables as parameters.

The Vue server closely follows the model outlined in the [Vue SSR Rendering Guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/) and adds in dynamic component loading and a few bits to handle the interaction with the crystal client.

The Svelte servers uses the [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) framework behind the scenes.

This is roughly the same architecture that AirBNB's [Hypernova](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova) uses, and has some of the same tradeoffs. While there's definitely some overhead in making HTTP requests, it's still extremely fast: A simple page render from Amber takes about 3ms on a 2015 MBP, including the back-and-forth over HTTP. This is an order of magnitude slower than a base case Amber render (approx. 300 microseconds). But it's fast enough for now, though most certainly an area to explore for future optimization.

I've tried to comment the code extensively, but I'm also writing this up in more detail mostly as a high-level reference _ahem_ and reminder to myself _cough_ about exactly how the various internals work.

## Project Status

My goal/philosophy is to release early, release often, and get as much user feedback as early in the process as possible, so even though the perfectionist in me would like to spend another 6 years improving this, by then it'll be 2024 and who knows we might all be living underwater. No time like the present.

## Roadmap

Short-term goals:

- [x] Release the embarrassing 0.1.0 version
- [x] Fix reloading issues (not everything restarts properly)
- [x] Figure out Hot Module Reloading (HMR)
- [x] Add support for Svelte
- [ ] Get usage --> expose bugs
- [ ] Automate installation
- [ ] Get example / demo project live
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Write more comprehensive tests
- [ ] Figure out CSS splitting
- [ ] Add support for preprocessors in .vue files (pug, SCSS, stylus, etc.)

Longer-term goals:

- Performance improvements
- Port to Ruby/Rails
- Remove need for a separate node process / http (evaluate JS in crystal, compile templates without Webpack?)
